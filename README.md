##1: SOFTWARE NAME:

GPIO Interactive Commands

##2: AUTHOR:

Kenta Ishii, alias [a.k.a] Jimmy Ken Merchant

##3: SOFTWARE TYPE:

Linux Shell Script for Raspbian Jessie on Raspberry Pi 2 Model B

##4: DISCREPTION

To develop prepherals using GPIO pins, you may set, signal, and monitor GPIO pins. This software help you for these matters interactively.
Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 become good PC rather than Microcontroller, you may not need such a function. Please don't use this shell script without readiness because making some pin enables causes to freeze your PI.
Besides, Zero and 1 are still a pair of Microcontroller by ARM architecture. You can touch these internal systems directly because these datasheets are open as opposed to 2 and 3.
In terms of embedded systems and industorial enginnering, CPU architecture should have reliability and continousness because of its maintenance and its inheritability to the next invention.
Zero and 1 uses 32 bits ARM Version 6 architecture. This is one of some suggestions to industorial enginnering. But you may watch any alternatives, PIC or even Ziglog Z80 which is a cherry tree of 8 bits Intel 8080.
